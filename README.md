# simple-file-upload-web-interface-for-afl-fuzz
Create a bin dir in the folder you're running the upload.py file.
Once you upload the file and want to fuzz it, kill the server and it will continue.
You will need to modify the code a bit if the binary you want to move into the bin isn't called a.out

More Fectures will be added very soon
